# Title: Looping Constructs in JavaScript

## 1. Introduction

This technical paper delves into various looping constructs in JavaScript, namely `for`, `forEach`, `for...in`, `for...of`, and `while`. 

## 2. The 'for' Loop

The classic `for` loop in JavaScript is versatile and commonly used for iterating a specific number of times.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

## 3. The 'forEach' Loop

The `forEach` loop is specific to arrays, offering a clean and expressive way to iterate through each element.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach((num) => {
  console.log(num);
});
```

## 4. The 'for...in' Loop

The `for...in` loop is designed for iterating over object properties. 

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, occupation: 'developer' };
for (let prop in person) {
  console.log(`${prop}: ${person[prop]}`);
}
```

## 5. The 'for...of' Loop

The `for...of` loop is specifically designed for iterating over iterable objects.

```javascript
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
for (const color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}
```

## 6. The 'while' Loop

The `while` loop continues iterating as long as the specified condition is true.

```javascript
let count = 0;
while (count < 3) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
```
